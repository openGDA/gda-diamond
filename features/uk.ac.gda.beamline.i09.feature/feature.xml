   <description url="http://www.opengda.org/">
      The GDA project is an open-source framework for creating customised
data acquisition software for science facilities such as neutron
and x-ray sources. The software is Java/Eclipse-based, free and
released under the GPLv3.
It is based on the Generic Data Acquisition (GDA) software developed
at Diamond Light Source. The GDA was initially developed at SRS
Daresbury but since 2003 it has been adopted by Diamond Light
Source who took over as the principal developer. The team at
Diamond have developed the GDA for the majority of Diamond beamlines
across all the scientific techniques at Diamond. GDA is the evolution
of that project and is intended to be applicable for any beamline
on any synchrotron facility.
From the outset the GDA has been designed to be generic and flexible
in its architecture to enable it to be customisable for any beamline
and any underlying hardware control system.
