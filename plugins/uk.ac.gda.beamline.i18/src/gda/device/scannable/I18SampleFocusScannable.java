/**
 * For moving the sample along the z-axis whilst preventing it shifting in x.
 * <p>
 * As I18 samples are held at 45deg to the beam so that the fluorescence detectors can see more sample then when the
 * sample is moved in z to change the focus it causes a small shift in x. So when changing the sample along the z-axis
 * during experiment setup this Scannable should be operated instead of the z motor.
 * <p>
 * So this reports the z-position, but when moved it also makes adjustments to the x motor position.
