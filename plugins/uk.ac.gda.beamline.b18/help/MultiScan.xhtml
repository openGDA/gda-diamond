    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Multiple scan perspective is availble for use when setting up a scan which will run many
      automated scans. You can refactor file names and build a queue of
      scans to run over a long period without user interaction. </p>
    <p/>
    <h4>Queue of Scans</h4>
    <p>Scans can be added to multiple scan files and the XML files for the scan settings can be
      edited, reused and copied. Scans not currently being run can be removed from the queue and
      edited before they are run. There is a Queue view to see the currently running scan and the other
      scans waiting to be run.</p>
    <p/>
    <h4>Refactor</h4>
    <p>Files can be managed copied and edited within the multiple scan perspective. When files are
      renamed the multiple scan file is updated with the new name. Multiple scan files are checked
      for existing files and yellow warning markers are shown if the scan is in error.</p>
