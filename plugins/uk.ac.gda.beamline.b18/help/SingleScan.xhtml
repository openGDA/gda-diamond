    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
    <p>When you first start using the system you will be editing a single scan. You can view the
      editors for changing the XML files which set the values input to the system when the 'Run a
      Scan' button is pressed. The files are saved to a directory and can be used from the command
      line to run a scan later. You can also enter muliple scan mode by pressing the 'Open
      Perspective' button and choosing the 'Multiple Scan' perspective.</p>
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <h4>Scripting Perspective</h4>
    <p>There is a scripting perspective available under the 'Open Perspective' button. This shows a
      terminal in which commands may be sent to the server controlling the experiment.</p>
