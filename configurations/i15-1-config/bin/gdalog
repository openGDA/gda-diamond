# This is required to be on the path until the Diamond Launcher scripts in
# /dls_sw/prod/etc/Launcher/startgda* use the standard startup commands,
# which cannot be done until all beamlines use the standard startup commands.

# As it should only ever be run by the diamond launcher or long time users
# who got used to running it this way, this script MUST only contain the
# following command:

gda logpanel $*

# Any other code must be added to "/etc/_common/gda_common_pre_instance"
# instead.
