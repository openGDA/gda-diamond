To run all beamline tests, all that is needed is to import them and run them:

from beamline_test import run_tests
run_tests()

To run all beamline tests, except email tests, run:

run_tests(marks='not email')

This requires marks support to be available.

Note, support for marks was cherry picked from change/36289/1 onto the
GDA 9.27 release branch for i15-1, to enable testing.
