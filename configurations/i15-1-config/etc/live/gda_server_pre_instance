# Since the gda_servers_* scripts are run on both the client machine and on the server
# machine in live mode, we would rather restart ActiveMQ on the client machine so we
# have access to stdout, but as we may need to delete /exports/activemq if required
# and this can only occur on the server, and we should only restart activemq once, instead
# it lives here for now, and may be moved to dls-config and parameterised per beamline with 
#dls-beamline-pv-prefix.sh when procServ management of ActiveMQ becomes the standard

# However, this means we cannot use echo, see gda_servers_core:165
