Hi Eric

Attached are the two virtual motor macros that we used in Pincer to send/receive strings to the Java software (called moke3D) that controls the magnet. 

The "vmag" VM is the main macro that sets the field and direction of the magnet. The "vflipper" VM includes calls to the vmag VM and is used in scans to flip the magnetic field at each point in the scan and record the counter-timer values.

I think in order to run the magnet successfully on I06 we would need to create some similar VMs on GDA.

It is possible to run the Java software in simulation mode (i.e. with the magnet switched off) in order to test that the calls are sent/received correctly. 

Best,
Neil.

Hi Neil,

From GDA point of view, what I need to know is a set of
commands(Strings) that your POMS computer accepts and the feedback. I also need to confirm the hardware interface used by POMS for connection.
Because the POMS is connected with DLS beamline network, I assume it is a socket device over tcp/ip.

I can be reached by phone tomorrow morning on 01235 778447 for further discussion.

Regards,

Eric

Hi Eric

I've tried contacting you several times about the software for the POMS magnet. As I said before I think it would be easier to discuss this over the phone rather than by email. I'm just a little aware that time is now getting quite tight. Could you let me know how this is going and when would be a good time to discuss this further? 

Many thanks,
Neil.

Hi Sarnjeet,

That's fine. Now all I need to know is that set of strings used by POMS so that GDA can send commands to change the magnetic field or inquire the status/current setting.

Regards,

Eric
