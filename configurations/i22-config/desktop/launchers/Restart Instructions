Restart Process for Data Acquisition 

Start in following order 
------------------------
All programs are available from the Desktop in the same folder 
"i22 Launchers" where you found this file you are currently reading.

1/ Start GDA Server (computer and world icon)
	It gives info when ready for the next step.  
2/ GDA_StartClient - gda icon 
	
Problems Starting the Client
----------------------------
If you have problems starting the client, resetting the "workspace" 
often helps. You do this by running the following in a terminal window:
	$ rm -rf /dls/i22/software/gda/config/var/.workspace-${USER}*
When you restart the client after that it will have come up with all
views and perspectives as well as other settings in default mode.

Detector Troubleshooting
------------------------
If you suspect a problem with the detector communitcations, you can 
see what happens using the RapidView, HotWaxsView and HotSaxsView
applications. 
Should the Views not open, someone needs to reboot the detector VME 
computer.
In case you believe you have to restart the detector server programm, 
open a terminal window (right click on the Desktop will open one) and 
type the command "RapidForceRestart", "HotWaxsForceRestart" and/or 
"HotSaxsForceRestart". In the View applications you will see some 
activity for a while. When you see two lines like
	/usr/local/bin/da.server - By Richard W.M. Jones, William I. Helsby.
	Listening for connections on port 1972.
You can restart GDA in the order above. 

If this fails call for help!!
