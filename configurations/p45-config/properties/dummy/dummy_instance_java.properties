#If any properties (keys) end up being duplicated, the 1st value that is set is what you end up with.
#See Jira ticket GDA-6106 for details

# This config is slightly unusual in having no specific properties here. All necessary properties for p45 are set in
# common_instance_java.properties, and live- and dummy- specific settings are handled in
# dls-config/live-facility-java.properties and dls-config/dummy-facility-java.properties

# Because MalcomDevice 
# 1) is not findable I cannot use the beanId 
# 2) in dummy mode the malcom name is parametrised as <property name="name" value="#{workstation}-ML-SCAN-02"/>
# the property values below has to be set before any simulation 
tomography.malcolm.device.tomo = ws157-ML-SCAN-02

#Add all dummy mode beamline specific keys before this line
include = ../_common/common_instance_java.properties
#Do not set any keys after this line as the value may not get set as expected.
