#tomography_translation is the motor used to move the sample out of the beam (x)
#Possible values:
#ss1_X  - normal sample table
#hex_x  - hexapod sample table
#ss1_X_dummy - a dummy motor used for testing
tomography_translation=ss1_X_dummy 

#tomography_theta is the motor used to rotate the sample
#Possible values:
# ss1_rot - normal goniometer, zebra test setup
# p2r_rot - p2r
#ss1_rot_dummy - a dummy motor used for testing
tomography_theta=ss1_rot_dummy


#tomography_optimizer is the device that checks if the beam current is of high enough value
tomography_optimizer=beam_optimizer

#tomography_detector is the detector used in stepped tomography scans
#Possible values:
#pco1_hw_tif - uses tfg trigger, saves each image to a separate tif file
#pco1_hw_hdf - uses tfg trigger, saves all images to 1 hdf file 
#tomography_detector=pco1_hw_hdf
tomography_detector=pco1_sw

#tomography_normalisedImage_detector is the detector used to take normalised images
#Possible values:
#pco1_hw_tif - to save to tif files
#pco1_hw_hdf_nochunking - to save to hdf with no chunking ( chunking only suitable for full projection sets)
tomography_normalisedImage_detector=pco1_sw

#tomography_shutter is the shutter that is closed to take a dark and opened for a flat and projection
#Possible values:
#eh_shtr_dummy - a dummy shutter used for testing, or when the shutter is being controlled by the detector and pco1_hw_tif.collectionStrategy.useShutterPV=True
#expt_fastshutter - the fast shutter , or when the shutter is being controlled by the detector and pco1_hw_tif.collectionStrategy.useShutterPV=False
tomography_shutter=eh_shtr_dummy

#make sure pco1_tif.collectionStrategy.shutterDarkScannable is set to this
