I15 (9.33)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User facing release notes...

The new way of loading the configuration has identified a circular reference
with respect to the second zebra box. Since we no longer use this box, I have
disabled the second zebra, and the unused devices associated with it.

I15 is now using the new logpanel, as I15-1 have done for a while.

We are now logging to only the new graylog server rather than to both old and
new graylog servers.
