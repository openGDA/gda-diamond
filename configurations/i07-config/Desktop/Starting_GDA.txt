Description of Icons:
"Restart GDA Server"    ( or command GDA_RemoteStart_Lin ) - restarts the backend processes. 
	The expected output of this command is:
	nohup: appending output to `nohup.out'
	Connection to i06-control.diamond.ac.uk closed.
"Start GDA Client"      ( or command GDA_StartClient     ) - start the client. This can only be done once the background servers have started fully.


If you stop the GUI then you do NOT have to restart the Server.  Stopping the GUI does not stop the GDA server.
