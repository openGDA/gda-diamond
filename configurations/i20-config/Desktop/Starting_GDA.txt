Description of Icons:
"Start GDA Log Display" ( or command GDA_StartlogPanel   ) - Opens the LogPanel that displays the messages from the different GDA processes
"View GDA Log File"    ( or command GDA_ShowLogFile     ) - displays the console log file from the backend processes
"Restart GDA Server"    ( or command GDA_RemoteStart_Lin ) - restarts the backend processes. 
	The expected output of this command is:
	nohup: appending output to `nohup.out'
	Connection to i20-control.diamond.ac.uk closed.
"Start GDA Client"      ( or command GDA_StartClient     ) - start the client. This can only be done once the background servers have started fully.

A restart of the GDA servers will take about 3 minutes. The end is signalled by the message:
	INFO  gda.util.ObjectServer - Server initialisation complete. xmlFile = /dls/ixx/software/gda/config/xml/server_epics.xml
in either the LogPanel or console log file.


If you stop the GUI then you do NOT have to restart the Server.  Stopping the GUI does not stop the GDA server.


Possible Problems.
On restart of GDA Servers the sample cannot be moved on the Sample Control panel. 

Solution
3. Close GDA client
4. Restart GDA Server
