Hi Eric

 

I've answered your questions in the text below...

 

-----Original Message-----



Hi Neil,

 

Thanks for the Pincer code. It helps me to roughly guess how to

communicate to your POMS system for the magnet control. If you can give

me a full list of communication commands/reply to drive the moke3D, it

will help me to setup GDA in DLS. So far, I can only find the following

messages used for communication from the Pincer macro:

Client(Pincer) can send two commands to the Server(moke3D)

      setFieldDirection ThetaValue, PhiValue

and   

      setField FieldValue delayTime

 

In both cases, the server reply either ERROR or something else. And it

seems there is no way to get the current magnetic field/direction values

from your server, so a client (Pincer or GDA) has to remember and uses

the last request values as the current magnet parameters. Is this

correct?

 

>>Yes, in fact these are the only two commands used. Pincer used to store the requested values as you have suggested above. 

 

>>The commands are as follows (basically what you've written above):

 

    setFieldDirection <delta> <phi>

 

    setField <field> <time_out>

 

>>The first command only needs to be called just once (though you will have to use it again to go the other, anti-parallel, direction) and when called it will zero the currents.

 

In addition, I have the following questions:

1. Before sending any commands to the server (moke3D), do we need to

check that the server is ready to receive command over socket?

 

>>No. 

 

2. After client sending a command to the server, can I assume that the

command is received and executed successfully after the client receives

a non ERROR message?

 

>>Yes.

 

3. How long does the POMS take to change the magnetic field and

direction? Instantly? 

 

>>It takes around 0.5 second to change the field.

 

4. Does the client need to put any delay between two communication

sessions?

 

>>I don't think so. 

 

5. In the flipper code, counter timers are used. Do you use your own

counter timers with POMS or you will use the beamline's. If the latter,

no problems. If the former, how to get the readings into GDA?

 

>>The plan is to use the beamline counter timers.

 

6. What the socket port used by moke3D? You mentioned this morning that

there is a simulation mode without using the magnet, how to start the

moke3D in a simulation mode? It will be useful to test my code based on

this simulation mode first.

 

>>There are several shortcuts stored on the POMS PC desktop that run the Java program in either normal or simulation mode. I left the simulation mode version running when I was down there last so unless someone has reset the machine, it should still be running. The main program is called moke3d_tcpip. The simulation version is called something similar (sorry I can't remember the name without looking at the PC). I think the socket port used should be stored in the shortcut as I believe you run the program by typing something like:

 

java com.amacc.moke3d.MokeMain <port>,   <port> being "COM1", "COM2", etc..

 

I think the simulation mode should run by adding the command TRUE to this statement. i.e...

 

java com.amacc.moke3d.Moke3DTCP COM3 4042 true

 

I think the actual program names have since changed from the above statements. Again, the current versions will be on the POMS PC.

 

 

7. What exactly does the flipper macro do? I guess it is a scan that

repeatedly changes the magnetic field/direction and takes a count. Can

you tell me more about this so that maybe I can help you to build the

same function in GDA without writing any new code.

 

>>I’ve attached some details about the vmag and vflipper macros (ignore 3 and 4).

 

 

I guess somehow Questions 1, 2, 3, 4 can be combined into one question:

do we have a checking status command so that a client can inquire the

moke3D what the current status is? Is it free to take command, or is it

busy on moving something, or is it in a faulty conditions, etc.

 

>>Below is an extract from an email sent between the Java programmer who made the moke3D software, and our in-house Pincer programmer who wrote the VMs. The “moke” he refers to is actually the octupole magnet. This may help answer your question…

  Yes, this seems correct, it was never supposed to show much useful info except that commands were received, and executed, (i.e. it doesn't dump the bytes that should have been sent to the moke). You should see

 

    Multi byte 90.

    Got 90.

 

  about ten times a second for approximately the duration of the pulse you specified as this is the "keep-alive" message to the moke (preventing it's 2 second watchdog from resetting the device).

 

> However I did notice an unexpected

  There is no fancy error handling since that wouldn't make much sense, if the connection generates an error it is simply left to die, just as if you would have disconnected (actually, that may just be what happened), and you will have to reconnect.

 

  I guess you could now test it with the moke connected. The displays on the power supplies will give you an initial indication of whether it is working (though they update very slowly). If anything seems wrong you can just disconnect the serial cable and the moke will reset within 2s (thus killing the magnet current).

 

  Actually, you can if you want first test it without turning on the PSs, just to check that the serial connection is working.

 

>> I hope this helps. It may be useful for you to go and look at the software on the POMS PC, if it is still running. This machine is in Gerrit van der Laan’s lab (near I06).

 

>> Please contact me if you need me to clarify anything.

>>Best,

>>Neil.
