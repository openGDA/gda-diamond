Look at the respective View window now. 
A successful restart will produce the following lines:

/usr/local/bin/da.server - By Richard W.M. Jones, William I. Helsby.
Listening for connections on port 1972.
Use ^C to quit scripts, wait etc, ^\ to really quit the server

Don't worry, it will need a couple of minutes with failed attempts before it works.
When the da.server is started successfully restart GDA server, then client.

If your problem persists you have to reboot the detector server (VME rack). 
Or call for help.
