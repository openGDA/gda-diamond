To run all beamline tests, all that is needed is to import them and run them:

    from beamline_test import run_tests
    run_tests()

To run all beamline tests, except the email tests, run:

    run_tests(marks='not email')

To run just the simple scan tests, for checking plot colours, run:

    run_tests(marks='plotting')
    
Note that if scans complain about the "butlerArm" then run:

    remove_default butler_position_warning
