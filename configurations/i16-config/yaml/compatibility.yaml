  # ------------------------------ Temporary ------------------------------
  # Various changes between NDW and NSD make comparing files difficult, so this
  # section is mostly about temporarily making NSD look more like NDW to make
  # it more obvious when things are missing from NSD nexus files.

  # The primary location of before_scan moved to /entry1/instrument/ from
  # /entry1/ so temporarily link it back to it's original location.
  before_scan: /entry1/instrument/before_scan

  # NSD uses scannable names instead of field names for single value metadata
  # entries, so temporarily create links from their original locations.
  # This works, but it requires every potential NXdata to be included here.
