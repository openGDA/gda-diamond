    # Various changes between NDW and NSD make comparing files difficult, so this
    # section is mostly about temporarily making NSD look more like NDW to make
    # it more obvious when things are missing from NSD nexus files.

    # This obscures where DefaultDataGroupConfiguration creates the measurement
    # group, so disable it when comparing NSD with NDW.
