Things changed:

1. Everything to Spring. Effects only how we write the xml files. Things will be in new (but logical!) places.
2. All OEs and DOFs to ScannableGroups and ScannableMotors.
3. Removed gapMotor for now
4. Removed Epics entries in interface file for Pilatus as these cause problems (I think at the gda side)
5. 'caput BL16I-OP-HFM-01:BEND.EGU mm' required to fix m2Bender scannables tat otherwise recieves the unit 'blah' from epics!
6. created and idgapmotor pointing to softmotor SR16I-MO-SERVC-01:BLGAPMTR
7. Removed relative limits from: kth/kdelta and gam/mu
8. Offset on delta is now handles using the new Scannable.setOffset() method. This is now called automatically when delta_axis_offset is modified.



In startup_epics_positioners, replaces some instances of homebrew SingleEpicsPositionerClass with ScannableMotor:

- m2bender (part of the m2 group)
- sx, sy, sz (now part of sixcsample group)
- basez1, basez2, basez3 and base_y (now part of sixcbase group). 
- finepitch, dcmlat, pitch, roll1, roll2, perp
