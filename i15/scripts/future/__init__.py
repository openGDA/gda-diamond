# This directory is a place holder for future scripts which we expect to
# be able to run from gdascripts in a future version of GDA.

# Scripts which in a future version of GDA will be in gdascripts should
# be placed here and referenced as

#   from future/feature import *

# When upgrading to that GDA version, these references can be changed to

#   from gdascripts/feature import *

# Changes to the local and gdascripts versions of these scripts can then
# be reconciled and the local versions deleted.
