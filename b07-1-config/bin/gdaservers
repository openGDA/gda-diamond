# The local gda script is required to be on the path until the Diamond Launcher scripts in
# /dls_sw/prod/etc/Launcher/startgda* use the standard startup commands, and
# this cannot be done until all beamlines use the standard startup commands.

# Via the standard scripts, invoke the command in gda2's ~/.ssh/authorisekeys file
# on the control machine passing the supplied option params (to support --debug etc.)
# 
# Since GDA 9 the gdaservers script allows selection and latching of the server target to start
# see http://confluence.diamond.ac.uk/display/CT/Deployment%2C+Target+Selection+and+Startup for details
# this is achieved via the gda_server_target_select.sh script.
#
# Entering gdaservers --help (-h) will give details of the options available (also via gda_server_target_select.sh).
