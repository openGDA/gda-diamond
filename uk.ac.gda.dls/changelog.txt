uk.ac.gda.dls CHANGELOG
=======================

Changes in version 8.2 (2010-02-xx)
-----------------------------------

* RTPImageProcessorBase has been removed. RTPCameraClient (used by JCameramanDisplayPanel on MX beamlines, and
  CmuCameraDisplayPanel on I19) and RTPCameraImageROISelector (used by CameraDisplayPanel on I18), which extended it,
  now just extend JLayeredPane directly. RTP streams can be received using an instance of the new RTPStreamReceiver
  class. RTPCameraClient and RTPCameraImageROISelector now implement the new ImageListener interface, and are added as
  listeners of the RTPStreamReceiver instance to receive images from the stream.
